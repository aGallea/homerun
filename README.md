HomeRun replaces the manual GitHub self-hosted runner setup process with a unified macOS desktop app and terminal UI. Authenticate with GitHub once, pick a repository, and launch runners with a single click. HomeRun handles download, registration, process management, log streaming, and resource monitoring — everything the official docs make you do by hand.

## Features

- **One-click runner setup** — no shell scripts, no copy-pasting tokens
- **Device Flow authentication** — log in with your GitHub account via browser; no PAT required
- **Batch runner creation** — spin up multiple runners for the same repo in one step with live progress
- **Unified dashboard** — monitor all runners across all repos in one place
- **Live log streaming** — tail runner output in real time from the runner detail view
- **Job tracking** — see current job name, busy state, and completed/failed job counters per runner
- **Real-time metrics** — CPU/RAM per runner via live WebSocket updates
- **Two run modes** — app-managed (daemon child) or background service (launchd)
- **Auto-restart** — crashed runners recover automatically (up to 3 attempts)
- **Smart repo discovery** — scan local workspace directories or your GitHub account for repos that use self-hosted runners
- **Terminal UI** — full keyboard-driven TUI with the same capabilities as the GUI
- **CLI mode** — scriptable `homerun --no-tui` commands for automation
- **macOS native** — Keychain token storage, launchd auto-start, native notifications
- **Pre-commit hooks** — enforces `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, conventional commits, and Prettier on every commit

Runners are native child processes of the daemon — not Docker containers. Each runner is an instance of the [official GitHub Actions runner binary](https://github.com/actions/runner). All GitHub communication is outbound HTTPS. No inbound ports needed.

For the full architecture deep-dive (runner lifecycle, state machine, process management, auth flow), see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

New to self-hosted runners? See [How Self-Hosted Runners Work](docs/SELF_HOSTED_RUNNERS.md) for a primer on runner communication, permissions, security considerations, and what HomeRun automates.

## Quick Start

### Install (DMG)

1. Download the latest `.dmg` for your architecture from [Releases](https://github.com/aGallea/homerun/releases):
   - **Apple Silicon** (M1/M2/M3/M4): `HomeRun_<version>_aarch64.dmg`
   - **Intel**: `HomeRun_<version>_x86_64.dmg`
2. Open the `.dmg` and drag HomeRun to Applications
3. Remove the macOS quarantine flag (required because the app is not yet code-signed):

   ```sh
   xattr -cr /Applications/HomeRun.app
   ```

4. Launch HomeRun — go to Settings > Startup > "Launch at login" to auto-start the daemon

The `.dmg` bundles the `homerund` daemon inside the app. Releases are automated via [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) — every merge to `master` with conventional commits triggers a Release PR with version bumps and changelog.

### Install (Homebrew)

> _Coming soon — see [#18](https://github.com/aGallea/homerun/issues/18)._

### Run

```sh
# Start the daemon
homerund

# Launch the TUI
homerun

# Or use CLI mode
homerun --no-tui list
```

## Screenshots

> _Screenshots coming soon — the app is under active development._

## CLI Usage

```sh
# List all runners
homerun --no-tui list

# Add 4 runners for a repo
homerun --no-tui add my-runner --count 4 --labels ci,e2e --mode service

# Check status
homerun --no-tui status

# Remove a runner
homerun --no-tui remove my-runner-2

# Scan workspace for repos using self-hosted runners
homerun --no-tui scan ~/workspace

# Scan GitHub repos remotely
homerun --no-tui scan --remote

# Login via GitHub Device Flow (no PAT needed)
homerun --no-tui login

# Or login with a Personal Access Token
homerun --no-tui login --token <PAT>
```
